## 🎨 My Work Highlights

### Notable Projects:
- **SimonCare Mobile App:** Enhancing location tracking and usability for caregivers and patients. Explored efficient, battery-saving location tracking techniques inspired by Life360.
- **Neural Network for Collision Prediction:** Designed and implemented a neural network using PyTorch for collision prediction in a simulated robotics environment. Collected and processed data from virtual robot sensors, trained the model using binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer, and achieved high accuracy in preventing collisions.
- **Healthcare Consulting Web App:** Built a comprehensive solution for healthcare analysis using React, Spring, and MongoDB.
- **Density Estimation and Classification:** Trained a Naive Bayes classifier on handwritten digits, achieving over 91% accuracy.Suggested adding a third feature (white line crossings) to improve accuracy.
